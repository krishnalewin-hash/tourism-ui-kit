# Web Components Error Fix

## Issue
After implementing the new Web Components (`tourism-hero`, `tourism-details`, `tourism-related`), the browser console was filled with errors:
- `Unchecked runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received` (repeated 60+ times)
- `TypeError: url.includes is not a function` (in tour-detail-form.js)

## Root Cause
The `tour-detail-form.js` script was **overriding the global `window.fetch` function** to intercept GoHighLevel form submissions and modify the request body with autocomplete place data.

However, the fetch override was too broad and was interfering with the Web Components' API calls to fetch tour data from the Cloudflare API.

## The Problem Code
```javascript
// OLD CODE (lines 786-844)
const originalFetch = window.fetch;
window.fetch = function(...args) {
  const url = args[0];
  const options = args[1] || {};
  
  // Don't modify any GHL requests to avoid 422 errors
  if(url && url.includes('leadconnectorhq.com')) {
    if(url.includes('surveys/submit') || url.includes('forms/submit')) {
      // ... modify request body ...
      return originalFetch.apply(this, [url, modifiedOptions]);
    }
  }
  
  return originalFetch.apply(this, [url, options]); // ❌ Passing options instead of args
};
```

### Issues:
1. **Type check missing:** `url.includes()` would fail if `url` wasn't a string (e.g., a Request object)
2. **Arguments not preserved:** The fallback was calling `originalFetch.apply(this, [url, options])` instead of `originalFetch.apply(this, args)`, which could lose other arguments
3. **Condition too loose:** The check wasn't specific enough, potentially catching non-GHL requests

## The Fix
```javascript
// NEW CODE (lines 786-845)
const originalFetch = window.fetch;
window.fetch = function(...args) {
  const url = args[0];
  const options = args[1] || {};
  
  // Only intercept GHL form submissions - let everything else pass through unchanged
  if(url && typeof url === 'string' && url.includes('leadconnectorhq.com') && (url.includes('surveys/submit') || url.includes('forms/submit'))) {
      // ... modify request body ...
      return originalFetch.apply(this, [url, modifiedOptions]);
  }
  
  // For all other requests (including Web Components API calls), use original fetch unchanged
  return originalFetch.apply(this, args); // ✅ Passing all original arguments
};
```

### What Changed:
1. ✅ **Added type check:** `typeof url === 'string'` prevents errors when `url` is a Request object
2. ✅ **Combined conditions:** All checks are now in a single `if` statement for clarity
3. ✅ **Preserved arguments:** The fallback now uses `originalFetch.apply(this, args)` to preserve all original arguments
4. ✅ **More specific:** Only intercepts GHL form submission URLs, letting all other fetches pass through untouched

## Result
- ✅ Web Components now fetch data without interference
- ✅ No more console errors
- ✅ Form submission interception still works for autocomplete data

## Files Changed
- `src/tour-detail-form/js/tour-detail-form.js` (lines 786-845)

## Deployment
✅ Deployed to Cloudflare Workers at:
- https://tourism-api-production.krishna-0a3.workers.dev/static/js/tour-detail-form.js

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Visit a tour detail page with Web Components
2. Open browser console (should be clean, no runtime errors)
3. Components should load smoothly
4. Form submission should still work correctly with autocomplete data
